 Clarity & Accuracy
  4/5 -   I was able to identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate in the subheadline, not quite in the headline itself.
          The main takeaway: At least 350 entire homes listed on Airbnb appear to be full-time vacation rentals, bolstering claims by activists that 
          the service removes scarce housing from the cityâ€™s limited inventory.
  3.5/5 - There were two data visualizations: an interactive map and a column chart.  
          Interactive map: It definitely took some reading to be able to understand how to make sense out of all of the data, but once I looked it over 
          carefully and read the full descriptions, it was a very informative and engagin graphic (4/5).
          Column chart: This one was definitely a bit more confusing. The two columns to the right of the graph were a bit tricky to figure out at first, 
          with a lot of different statistics and numbers on the same column (3/5).
          I would say to stick to a more simple layout in the column chart,




4. This story would be about media coverage of murders and disappearances of white people versus people of color and marginalized groups. 

    This comes in light of the Gabby Petito case, where a lot of questions are being raised about the reason her case specifically has gotten 
    so much national coverage when people of color, especially indigenous people, go missing or get murdered at even higher rates with little to no coverage.

    Data could be obtained from police departments, the FBI and other law enforcement agencies that investigate these kinds of cases. 

    Data could also be taken from social media sites (Twitter, FaceBook, etc.) to track the amount of attention (likes, retweets) particular stories receive.

    Data could also be retrieved from news organizations to track the amount of coverage and news stories relating to these topics. 

    Interviews could be conducted with detectives who have worked on such cases, editors making decisions at news organizations, families of victims, 

    The question would essentially be: "Why do white victims (often young, attractive white women) in these cases generate so much more attention and media coverage 
    than victims of color?"
