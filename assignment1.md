__CRITIQUE__

 __Clarity & Accuracy__
  <p>4/5 -   I was able to identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate in the subheadline, not quite in the headline itself.
          The main takeaway: At least 350 entire homes listed on Airbnb appear to be full-time vacation rentals, bolstering claims by activists that 
          the service removes scarce housing from the cityâ€™s limited inventory.
 <p>3.5/5 - There were two data visualizations: an interactive map and a column chart. <p/>
          <p>Interactive map: It definitely took some reading to be able to understand how to make sense out of all of the data, but once I looked it over 
          carefully and read the full descriptions, it was a very informative and engagin graphic (4/5).<p/>
          <p>Column chart: This one was definitely a bit more confusing. The two columns to the right of the graph were a bit tricky to figure out at first, 
          with a lot of different statistics and numbers on the same column (3/5).<p>
          I would say to stick to a more simple layout in the column chart, don't pack too many statistics into a single column.
<p> 4.5 - I think the data looks mostly accurate. The Chronicle commissioned data-extraction companies Connotate Inc. and Import.io to harvest San Francisco information from the Airbnb, HomeAway and FlipKey websites on May 19. Connotate also extracted Airbnb listing data for The Chronicle on the same date in 2014, allowing for insights about year-over-year changes. This suggests a wide range of data over an extended period of time. They clearly explained the source of the data and explained how they extracted it.
  <p> The reporter might have also checked with other rental companies, hotels, etc. to compare air bnb data with<p/>
  
__Quality__
<p> 4 - I would say this is pretty high quality. Including an interactive map was a good decision for this particular story so readers can observe changes over 
  time among different geographic areas. Especially because this is a local San Francisco publication, the more specific the piece is about the particular San Francisco neighborhoods, the more people will be inerested to observe statistics and information about where they live. I think the column chart could definitely use some work to make it clearer and easier to understand. <p/>
  
  __Type and Color__
  <p> Type (3.5) - The font itself was fine and easily legible but two different fonts were used for the two graphics. I think using the same font would keep the piece more consistent and give it a better flow. 
  <p> Color (5) - I think color was used really well. In the interactive map, there was a gradient scale used where the light yellow indicated the lowest number and  dark red indicated the highest number, with a gradient in between. This is easy to follow as darker colors usually indicate more condensed or higher instances of a certain statistic. In the column chart, two different colors were used for different years and they were different enough that they contrasted well to easily be able to tell them apart.<p/>
  
  __Creativity__
  
  <p> 4 - I think the interactive map was the main feature of this story. It is very attention grabbing and creative in its layout. It presented important data and localized it to the main audience of this publication. The column chart was not very creative but did add important information. 
  
  
    
          
         



__PITCH__
  
This story would be about media coverage of murders and disappearances of white people versus people of color and marginalized groups. 

    This comes in light of the Gabby Petito case, where a lot of questions are being raised about the reason her case specifically has gotten 
    so much national coverage when people of color, especially indigenous people, go missing or get murdered at even higher rates with little to no coverage.

    Data could be obtained from police departments, the FBI and other law enforcement agencies that investigate these kinds of cases. 

    Data could also be taken from social media sites (Twitter, FaceBook, etc.) to track the amount of attention (likes, retweets) particular stories receive.

    Data could also be retrieved from news organizations to track the amount of coverage and news stories relating to these topics. 

    Interviews could be conducted with detectives who have worked on such cases, editors making decisions at news organizations, families of victims, 

    The question would essentially be: "Why do white victims (often young, attractive white women) in these cases generate so much more attention and media coverage 
    than victims of color?"
